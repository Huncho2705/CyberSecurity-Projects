 On the page above **(Transform Hub)**, ensure you install all the **Transform Providers** you see, it is highly recommended because it helps to widen the scope of the results of any searches made. The more you install, the wider your search outcomes because each provider provides a set of transforms tailored for specific types of investigations. **Note that;** some of the **Transform Providers** ([Hybrid Analysis](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/) & [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) etc) requires an API Key or API Secret before successfully installing, all that's needed to get an API Key is signing up an account on their website, your API Key would be in your profile **(Do not share your API's with another party!).** 

 Having installed all necessary **Transform Provider**, click on **Next** at the top left side to open a new graph (this is where all the data will be displayed & you can also interact with your target) for any kind of investigations, research or open source intelligence you want to make findings about. 

 To make any investigations on a target, you must search for the entity on the **Entity Palette** on the left side beside the **Graph**, there are options of entities to search for; person, geographical location, email, IPv4 & IPv6 addresses, celebrity, gang member, businessman, crypto address, phone number, company, law enforcement officer, social media account and a whole lot more entities to lookup for information gathering. Whatever entity you wish to conduct an investigation on, click on it and drag it to the graph to begin the gathering. 
 
  **OVERVIEW PANE** >> This space is at your right hand side beside the graph, and it is used to interact with graph, makes it easier to scroll round the graph in the case of bigger searches.
  
  **DETAIL VIEW PANE** >> Directly underneath the **Overview Pane**, this space will show you details of the entity/domain you made investigations on. 
  
 **PROPERTY VIEW PANE** >> Below the **Detail View Pane**, where you can change the domain from the old to a new one if necessary.
