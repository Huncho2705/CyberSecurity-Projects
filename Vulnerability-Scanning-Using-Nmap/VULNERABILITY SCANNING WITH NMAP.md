#                  VULNERABILITY SCANNING ON A METASPLOITABLE 2 VM USING NMAP

 Network Mapper, widely known as NMAP, is a powerful network & port scanning tool created by Gordon Lyod (Fyodor) to discover hosts and operating services running on a system, or a collection of networks. Its use cases involves; Penetration Testing, Network Troubleshooting, Security Assessment. Nmap has quite a number of different scans & each scan has it's command, using a metasploitable 2 VM's IP as a case study;

 `nmap -sn 192.168.27.12` >> performs a ping scan only, it tells if host is online or offline

 `nmap -p- 192.168.27.12` >> Scans all ports

 `nmap -sS 192.168.27.12` >> Stealth SYN scan

 `nmap -sC 192.168.27.12` >> default script scan

 `nmap -f 192.168.27.12` >> firewall bypass scan

 `nmap 192.168.27.0/24` >> scans a range of subnet

 `nmap 192.168.27.1-254` >> Basic scan for a range of IP

 `nmap -sU 192.168.27.12` >> scans for all UDP open ports
 
 `nmap -O 192.168.27.12` >> Operating system detection scan

 `nmap -sV 192.168.27.12` >> Service and Version detection scan

 `nmap -iL targets.txt` >> scans IPs listed in the specified file

 `nmap -T<0-5> 192.168.27.12` >> Time scan T0-T5 slowest to fastest

 `nmap -p 22,80,443 192.168.27.12` >> scans only the specified ports

 `nmap -A 192.168.27.12` >> OS & Service detection + traceroute scan

 `nmap --script <script-name> 192.168.27.12` >> specific script scan

 `nmap -T4 -A -v 192.168.27.12` >> OS detection + Time scan + Version detection scan


### TIMING & PERFORMANCES SCAN

 `nmap -T0 192.168.27.12` >> very slow, mostly used for stealth scans
 
 `nmap -T1 192.168.27.12` >> sneaky scan, slow & stealth for a long period
 
 `nmap -T2 192.168.27.12` >> polite, reduces network bandwidth uses

 `nmap -T3 192.168.27.12` >> normal default scan

 `nmap -T4 192.168.27.12` >> aggressive, fast and reliable scan

 `nmap -T5 192.168.27.12` >> insane, very fast and extraordinarily reliable scan



### NSE SCRIPTS ENGINE SCAN

 `nmap --script smb-vuln 192.168.27.12` >> checks for vulnerabilities in the Server Message Block protocol SMB(used for metasploit exploits)
 
 `nmap --script http-vuln 192.168.27.12` >> checks & detects HTTP vulnerabilities which is port 80

 `nmap --script all 192.168.27.12` >> executes all available scripts. it takes longer time and has potential disruption

 `nmap --script http-enum 192.168.27.12` >> enumerates HTTP directories & services

 `nmap --script ftp-vuln 192.168.27.12` >> checks for misconfiguration or vulnerability in the File Transfer Protocol FTP service

 `nmap --script exploit 192.168.27.12` >> uses exploit scripts to identify exploitable vulnerability

 `nmap --script-trace 192.168.27.12` >> shows all data sent and received

**IPORTANT! >> scripts can be found in the ***"/usr/share/nmap/scripts"*** folder, while `ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts | grep <keyword>` is the command to search for specific scripts.**



### NMAP OPERATING SYSTEM VERSIONS;

 **Download for Windows** at [Nmap for Windows](https://nmap.org/download#windows)

 **Download for Mac's** >> Open terminal, input

 `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"` >> this installs **Homebrew**


 **Download for Linux PC's;**

 *OpenSuse* >> `sudo zypper install nmap`

 *Debian/Ubuntu* >> `sudo apt update && sudo apt install nmap -y`

 *Fedora/CentOS/Red Hat* >> `sudo dnf/yum install nmap -y`

 *Arch Linux/Manjaro* >> `sudo pacman -S nmap`

 










**IMPORTANT! >> "-Pn" added to any scan command treats the host as online, it skips the host discovery process**

**IMPORTANT! >> "-sn" disables port scanning, host discovery scan only**
